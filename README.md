# Chess-Game

This project is the regular game of chess written in Python.
The code is all my own.

## Project Goals
1) Finishing the movement functionality of all pieces on the chess board.
2) Adding a simple algorithm which will be used as an Artifiical Intelligence that the player can play against.
