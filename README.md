# Chess-Game

This project is the regular game of chess written in Python.
The code is all my own.

Enjoy.

## Project Goals
1) Finishing the movement functionality of all pieces on the chess board.
2) Adding a simple algorithm which will be used as an Artifiical Intelligence that the player can play against. 
   - The algorithm should eventually be able to include different difficulties for the player to choose to play against.
3) Add more comments to the code to make sure that each line is accounted or, and is easy to understand. 

## Completed Goals
1) Chess Board
